<span class="textcenter"><b>Current Internship: Math Tutoring and Young Maker Club</b></span>
<p class="center content">Right now I intern with Pam helping to run the Met math tutoring program and the Young Maker Club. I'm in charge of the  Young Maker Maker Club this year, and it's my job to plan and direct the meetings. The club recently received a grant for four Arduinos, two Raspberry Pis, an iPad and a soldering iron. At the most recent meeting, we started working on our project that we plan to take to the Maker Faire. It's a Rube Goldberg machine that will hopefully roast marshmallows when it's finished.<br />Some of the jobs that I do for the math tutoring program include data entry and data analysis. Below is a screenshot of a spreadsheet which contains data from the Summer Geometry class. Names have been removed for reasons that should be obvious.</p><br />

<span class="textcenter"><b>Past Internship: Serna Center</b></span>
<p class="center content">My sophomore and junior year internship was at the Serna Center, with the Webmaster of the Sacramento City Unified School District. I was there from Jenuary 2012 to June 2013. There, I learned how to code in HTML, JavaScript, and PHP. I can still learn more about all three of those, but I have a good enough basic understanding to make simple dynamic webpages. While I was there, I performed maintenance on the SCUSD website, checked the site's Analytics data, and worked on my final project. Below you can see a graph of the viewers of SCUSD.edu from December 2011 to September 2012.</p><br />

<span class="textcenter"><b>Past Internship: Palmer's Pursuit Shop</b></span>
<p class="center content">My internship Freshman year was at Palmer's Pursuit Shop. They were a machine shop that manufactured paintball guns. I would make various parts using the machines that they had there. I learned the proper ways to operate the machines safely and carefully. My project was to find out what the optimal length was for a paintball gun barrel. I started with a four or five foot long barrel, fired some shots out of it, shaved off a few inches, then did it again.</p>
